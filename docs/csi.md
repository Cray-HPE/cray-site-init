## csi

Cray Site Init. For new sites, re-installs, and upgrades.

### Synopsis


		CSI creates, validates, installs, and upgrades a CRAY supercomputer or HPCaaS platform.

		It supports initializing a set of configuration files from a variety of inputs including
		flags and Shasta 1.3 configuration files. It can also validate that a set of
		configuration details are accurate before attempting to use them for installation.

		Configs aside, this will prepare USB sticks for deploying on baremetal or for recovery and
		triage.
