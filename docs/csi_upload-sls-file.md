## csi upload-sls-file

Upload the sls_input_file.json file into the SLS S3 Bucket

### Synopsis

Upload the given sls_input_file.json file into the SLS S3 Bucket.
	Example: csi upload-sls-file --sls-file /path/to/sls_input_file.json

	Upload the given sls_input_file.json file into the SLS S3 Bucket, and delete the key "uploaded" if present in the SLS S3 bucket.
	The "upload" flag is added by the SLS loader when it successfully loads SLS with data, and it is used as flag to determine if 
	the SLS loader has been used previously to upload the SLS file. If it is present the loader will not upload the SLS file.

	Example: csi upload-sls-file --sls-file /path/to/sls_input_file.json --remove-upload-flag
